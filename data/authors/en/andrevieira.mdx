Hello! How are you?

My name is **Andr√© Luiz Vieira**, I am a Full-stack developer passionate about technology and all the incredible things it provides us! I love what I do and I am focused on becoming a great developer. My goal is to help people with the aid of technology. I am from Curitiba, Brazil, and I invite you to get to know me a little more.

## My passion for technology
Technology has always been my area of greatest interest. I like to think about the infinite things I can do with it, and that led me to the field of development.

I am a Fullstack developer, but I specifically work with Frontend. I have knowledge in technologies such as **JavaScript, ReactJS, React Native, Typescript, Git**, relational databases, and I have had the opportunity to work with or study Python, Django, PHP, and much more. But I do not intend to stop seeking new knowledge. I always have plans to learn new things like Node, Swift, Kotlin, and so on.

It all started with a desire to work in the digital games market. This led me to study information systems, and later I joined the bootcamp at [Kenzie Academy Brazil](https://www.kenzie.com.br), where I learned Frontend and Backend technologies, becoming a Full-stack developer.

Much effort, dedication, and preparation led me to the job market as a developer, where I have been working since then. With much love and dedication to this field, I have been continuously striving to evolve as a professional.

<mark>My goal is to become a complete developer mastering</mark> the main tools adopted by the market such as React, Next, React Native, etc.

With great pride, since 2021 I have been working at [DB1 Global Software](https://www.db1.com.br/), a company of the [DB1 Group](https://db1group.com). I am not ashamed to say that I am still in the process of learning and growing as a developer. I eagerly await the next challenges in my career to help others and solve problems with technology.

## Music addict
I have been in contact with music since I was 12 years old when I started taking drum lessons. Music plays a fundamental role in my daily concentration, in the way I develop my **creativity and productivity**. Not only during work but also while I am at the gym, in traffic, and so on.

I have been a musician in my church since 2019 and I learned to play the keyboard on my own. <mark>I have never had problems learning new things, which makes me quick and proactive in learning</mark> new programming languages, frameworks, languages, instruments, etc.

## New experiences
Working as a developer, I spend hours studying and working in front of the computer, and that cannot be a problem for me to see the world around me. That's why I love leisure moments with my family, traveling, and any opportunity to create a unique and special moment.

Despite having many dreams, goals, and achievements, I believe we have to live life in the best possible way, enjoying every day and detail. I am not ashamed to prioritize the people around me because I know that one day I will achieve my dreams with the people I love by my side.
