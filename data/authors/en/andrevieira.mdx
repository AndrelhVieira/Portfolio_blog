Hello! How are you?

My name is **Andr√© Luiz Vieira**, I am a Full-stack developer passionate about technology and all the amazing things it provides us! I love what I do and I am focused on becoming a better developer every day. My goal is to help people through technology. I am from Curitiba, Brazil, and I invite you to get to know me a little better.

## My Passion for Technology
Technology has always been my area of greatest interest. I like to think about the endless things I can do with it, and this led me to the field of development.

I am a Full-stack developer, but I have been specifically working with Frontend. I have knowledge in technologies like **JavaScript, ReactJS, React Native, TypeScript, Git**, relational databases, and I have had the opportunity to work or study with Python, Django, PHP, and much more. I do not intend to stop seeking new knowledge and always have plans to learn new things.

It all started with a desire to work in the digital games market. This led me to study information systems, and later I joined the bootcamp at [Kenzie Academy Brasil](https://www.kenzie.com.br), where I learned Frontend and Backend technologies, becoming a Full-stack developer.

A lot of effort, dedication, and preparation led me to the job market as a developer, where I have been working ever since. With a lot of love and dedication for this area, I have been continually striving to evolve as a professional.

<mark>My goal is to become a complete developer</mark> mastering the main tools adopted by the market such as React, Next, React Native, Node, etc.

Since 2021 I have been working at [DB1 Global Software](https://www.db1.com.br/), a company of the [DB1 Group](https://db1group.com). I look forward to the next challenges in my career to help others and solve problems with technology.

## Music Enthusiast
I have been involved with music since I was 12 years old when I started taking drum lessons. Music plays a fundamental role in my daily concentration, and in the way I develop my **creativity and productivity**. Not only during work but also while I am at the gym, in traffic, and so on. I have been a musician since I was 16 years old when I started with drums, and later, I learned to play the keyboard on my own.

<mark>I have never had problems learning new things, which makes me quick and proactive in learning</mark> new programming languages, frameworks, languages, instruments, etc.

## New Experiences
Working as a developer, I spend hours studying and working in front of the computer, and this cannot be a problem to see the world around me. Therefore, I love leisure moments with my family, trips, and any opportunity to create a unique and special moment.

Despite having many dreams, goals, and achievements, I believe that we must live life in the best possible way, enjoying each day and every detail. I am not ashamed to prioritize the people around me because I know that one day I will achieve my dreams with the people I love by my side.
