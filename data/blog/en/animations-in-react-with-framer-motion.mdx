# Introduction
Animations are the beating heart of a captivating user interface. They add life and personality, transforming a static application into a dynamic and engaging experience that speaks to the user.

In the universe of React, creating animations may seem challenging at first glance. However, with the help of the Framer Motion library, you can create smooth and stunning animations with ease.

## Practical Examples
Let’s start with a simple example. Say you have a `Button` component and you want to make a fade-in animation when it is mounted. You can use the `Framer Motion` library for this.

First, install the library with the command `npm install framer-motion`.

Here’s the code for the `Button` component:

``` js
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const Button = () => {
  return (
    <motion.button
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 1 }}
    >
      Click me
    </motion.button>
  );
}
```

In this example, the button will gradually appear over one second when the `Button` component is mounted.

Now, let’s try something a bit more complex. Let’s create a list of items that animate items in and out when they are added or removed.

``` js
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';

const ItemList = ({ items }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {items.map(item => (
          <motion.li
            key={item.id}
            initial={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1, height: 'auto' }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}
          >
            {item.text}
          </motion.li>
        ))}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In this example, each item in the list will smoothly appear and disappear when it is added or removed from the item list.

# Conclusion
Mastering animations in React with Framer Motion opens up a world of possibilities for enhancing user experience in your applications. With practice and patience, you’ll be able to create complex and engaging animations that will delight your users.
