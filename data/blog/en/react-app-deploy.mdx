# Introduction
The deploy process is a crucial step in the development of a React application. It is in this phase that the application is made available to the end user, and therefore, it is essential that it runs correctly and efficiently.

Many novice developers may encounter difficulties in this process, mainly due to the lack of knowledge regarding the best practices and tools available. But don’t worry, because in this post we’ll teach you how to deploy a React application in a simple and fast way.

By following the guidelines and tips that we will present here, you will be able to make your React applications available in production environments, thus ensuring the best experience for your end users. So let’s start?

## Step 1: Prepare the Application for Deployment
Before starting the deployment process, it is important to prepare the application for the production environment. For this, it is necessary to perform some configurations in the `package.json` file, such as defining the script for the build and specifying the version of Node.js to be used. Below is an example of a `package.json` file configured for deploy:

``` json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My React App",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "deploy": "npm run build && node deploy.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=14.0.0"
  }
}
```

Note that a new script called deploy was created, which builds the application and then executes a deploy.js file (which does not yet exist). In the engines section, it was defined that the application requires Node.js at least version 14.0.0. This configuration is important to ensure application compatibility with the production environment.

## Step 2: Build the Application
The next step is to build the application. To do this, just run the npm run build command in the terminal, inside the project folder. This command will generate the necessary files to run the application in production.

## Step 3: Choose a Hosting Service
There are several hosting service options available for deploying React applications, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Netlify, among others. In this example, we are going to use the Netlify service, which offers a free and simple plan to use.

## Step 4: Configure the Hosting Service
After choosing the hosting service, it is necessary to configure the deployment environment. In the case of Netlify, just create a new account on the site and then click on “New site from Git”. Choose the “GitHub” option, select the React application repository and click “Deploy site”.

## Step 5: Run the Deploy File
Finally, it is necessary to execute the deploy.js file, which was defined in the deploy script of the package.json file.

1. Create a deploy.js file in the root of the project with the following content:
``` javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(port, function() {
  console.log(`Server running at port: ${port}`);
});
```

This file creates an Express server that serves the static files generated by the application build.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the .gitignore file:

``` ignore
# Netlify
/build
```

These lines indicate that the build folder, which contains the files generated by the application’s build, should not be included in Git’s version control.

3. Run the following command in the terminal to deploy the application:

``` bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will build the application and then run the deploy.js file. Wait a few moments for Netlify to finish deploying the application.

# Conclusion
With these steps, you can deploy a React application simply and quickly. Of course, there are many other settings and tools that can be used to streamline the deployment process, but these steps are a good starting point for those just starting out.

Remember to always test the application after deploying and ensure that it is working correctly on all devices. With these best practices, you can provide the best possible experience for your users.
