Writing code is easy. Writing clean, readable, and sustainable code is a challenge. Anyone who has dealt with messy code knows how much of a nightmare it can be. This is where the teachings of Robert C. Martin, better known as Uncle Bob, made all the difference for me. The book *Clean Code* changed the way I program, and in this article, I share seven fundamental principles Iâ€™ve learned and apply in my daily work.

**Clean Code in Practice: Valuable Lessons I Learned from Uncle Bob**  

### 1. Meaningful and Expressive Names  

Names matter. Variables, functions, and classes should have names that clearly communicate their intent. Instead of something like:  

```typescript
let d = new Date();
```  

Prefer:  

```typescript
let currentDate = new Date();
```  

This improves readability and reduces the need for unnecessary comments. Code that explains itself is clean code.  

### 2. Small Functions with a Single Responsibility  

Functions should do only one thing and do it well. If you need to describe a function with an "and," it is probably doing more than it should:  

```typescript
function processPayment(user, amount) {
    validateUser(user);
    calculateDiscount(user);
    chargeUser(user, amount);
    sendConfirmationEmail(user);
}
```  

This function has multiple responsibilities. We can break it into smaller functions:  

```typescript
function processPayment(user, amount) {
    if (!validateUser(user)) return;
    const finalAmount = calculateDiscount(user, amount);
    chargeUser(user, finalAmount);
    notifyUser(user);
}
```  

This makes the code more modular, reusable, and easier to test.  

### 3. Avoid Unnecessary Comments  

Comments are useful when they explain *why* something was done, not *what* is being done. If the code requires a comment to be understood, it is probably not clean. Compare:  

```typescript
// Checks if the user has permission
if (user.role === 'admin') {
    allowAccess();
}
```  

With self-explanatory code:  

```typescript
const isAdmin = user.role === 'admin';
if (isAdmin) allowAccess();
```  

Whenever possible, let the code speak for itself.  

### 4. Reduce Dependencies and Avoid Repetitive Code (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)  

Duplicating code increases complexity and makes maintenance harder. If you notice repeating patterns, encapsulate them in a function:  

```typescript
function calculateFinalPrice(price, discount) {
    return price - (price * discount);
}

const productA = calculateFinalPrice(100, 0.1);
const productB = calculateFinalPrice(200, 0.2);
```  

This avoids repeating logic and makes maintenance easier.  

### 5. Use Simple Control Structures  

Avoid deep nesting, which makes code harder to read. Hereâ€™s a bad example:  

```typescript
if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
        if (user.hasPermission) {
            grantAccess();
        }
    }
}
```  

A cleaner way to write it:  

```typescript
if (!user || !user.isActive || !user.hasPermission) return;
grantAccess();
```  

This improves readability and makes the code more elegant.  

### 6. Test Your Code  

Clean code is not just readable but also reliable. Writing automated tests ensures that functions do what they are supposed to. For example, a test for the `calculateFinalPrice` function could be:  

```typescript
test('calculateFinalPrice should apply discount correctly', () => {
    expect(calculateFinalPrice(100, 0.1)).toBe(90);
    expect(calculateFinalPrice(200, 0.2)).toBe(160);
});
```  

This prevents future changes from introducing bugs without us noticing.  

### 7. Continuous Refactoring  

Clean code is not written perfectly the first timeâ€”it is refined over time. Refactoring should be a continuous practice to keep the code simple and efficient. If something can be improved, do it!  

Consider this example:  

```typescript
function getUserFullName(user) {
    return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}
```  

We can refactor it using template literals:  

```typescript
function getUserFullName(user) {
    return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
}
```  

Small improvements add up and make a big difference in code quality.

### Conclusion  

Learning Clean Code with Uncle Bob changed my perspective on development. Applying these principles results in more readable, maintainable, and sustainable code. In the end, clean code is not just a favor for other developersâ€”itâ€™s a gift to our *future selves*.  

How about starting to apply these practices in your code today? ðŸš€
