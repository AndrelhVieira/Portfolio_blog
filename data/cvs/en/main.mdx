# Profile

My cosmopolitan background and analytical interests in other cultures together with a command of several European languages allow me to manage multinational workforces that require the reconciliation of different national approaches to the performance arts. A proven leader with deep expertise in operations, production, and human management techniques, I quickly adapt to new challenges and easily motivate production project consensus, approval, coordination, funding, staging, and launch.
